# ✅ Round 3: Critical Quote Mismatch Fix

**Status**: Fixed reverse quote mismatches  
**Date**: October 21, 2025

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

Round 2's regex replacement accidentally created **REVERSE quote mismatches**:
- Changed closing `"` to `'` 
- But kept opening `"` 
- Result: `"@/shared/ui/primitives/button'` ❌

This caused "Unterminated string constant" errors in ~15+ files.

---

## 🔧 **The Fix**

Standardized ALL import quotes to double quotes (`"`) using regex:

```powershell
# Pattern 1: "@/shared/ui/primitives/component' → "@/shared/ui/primitives/component"
$content -replace "`"@/shared/ui/primitives/([^'`"]+)'", '"@/shared/ui/primitives/$1"'

# Pattern 2: '@/shared/ui/primitives/component" → "@/shared/ui/primitives/component"
$content -replace "'@/shared/ui/primitives/([^'`"]+)`"", '"@/shared/ui/primitives/$1"'
```

## 📋 **Files Fixed**

### Critical Files (11 files):
1. ✅ `src/components/DrillDetailModal.jsx`
2. ✅ `src/shared/ui/primitives/sidebar.jsx`
3. ✅ `src/pages/Player.jsx`
4. ✅ `src/pages/SyncStatus.jsx`
5. ✅ `src/pages/Analytics.jsx`
6. ✅ `src/pages/AddPlayer.jsx`
7. ✅ `src/pages/AddReport.jsx`
8. ✅ `src/pages/Login.jsx`
9. ✅ `src/pages/GamesSchedule.jsx`
10. ✅ `src/pages/AccessDenied.jsx`
11. ✅ `src/pages/TacticBoard.jsx`

### Additional Fixes:
- ✅ `src/components/DrillMenuDropdown.jsx` - Added `/primitives/` to `dropdown-menu` import

---

## 📊 **Expected Result**

All **"Unterminated string constant"** errors should be resolved.

**Before:**
```javascript
// ❌ Mismatch
import { Button } from "@/shared/ui/primitives/button';
import { Card } from '@/shared/ui/primitives/card";
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ✅ Consistent
import { Button } from "@/shared/ui/primitives/button";
import { Card } from "@/shared/ui/primitives/card";
```

---

## 🧪 **Test Again**

Run the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ NO "Unterminated string constant" errors
- ✅ App should load successfully
- ⚠️ Possibly a few minor import path issues (easy to fix)

---

## 🎯 **Remaining Potential Issues**

If you still see errors, they'll likely be:
1. ❌ Missing `/primitives/` on a few components
2. ❌ Files that were locked during the fix (close them in IDE and rerun)
3. ❌ Circular dependency issues (rare)
