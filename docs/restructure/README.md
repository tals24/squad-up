## 🎯 **Quick Overview**

### **What Was Done**
✅ **Phase 0**: Cleanup & tooling (ESLint, Prettier)  
✅ **Phase 1**: Shared layer (ui, components, hooks, utils)  
✅ **Phase 2**: App layer (router, providers, layout)  
✅ **Phase 3**: Features layer (8 organized features)  

### **Architecture Change**
**Before**: Monolithic structure  
**After**: Feature-Sliced Design with 3 layers:
- `app/` - Application layer
- `features/` - Feature modules (8 features)
- `shared/` - Shared resources

### **Results**
- **224 files changed**
- **+6,256 insertions, -7,202 deletions**
- **8 features** organized
- **50+ UI components** in shared layer
- **All features tested and working**

### **Import Paths**
- `@/shared/*` - Shared resources
- `@/features/*` - Feature modules
- `@/app/*` - App layer

### **Adding New Features**
1. Create directory in `src/features/new-feature/`
2. Add structure: `api/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`
3. Create `index.js` for public API
4. Update router in `src/app/router/routes.jsx`
