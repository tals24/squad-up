# Issues to Solve Later

## Test Failures in `validation.integration.test.jsx`

**Status**: 7 tests failing, 6 tests passing (out of 13 total)

**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19

---

## Failing Tests Summary

### 1. `should block "Game Was Played" with incomplete formation`
**Test Location**: `Starting Lineup Validation` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that the system blocks marking a game as played when only 5 players are assigned to the starting lineup (instead of 11).

**Expected Result**: Error modal appears with message matching `/Cannot mark game as played.*Only \d+ players in starting lineup/` OR `/Cannot mark game as played.*No players assigned to starting lineup/`

**Why it's failing**: 
- **Root Cause**: The component's formation auto-build logic isn't working correctly in the test environment
- **Issue**: `gamePlayers` array is empty (`gamePlayersCount: 0`) because team filtering isn't working properly
- **Details**: The component filters players by team ID, but the async nature of game loading → team filtering → formation building isn't completing before the test assertions run
- **Console logs show**: `⚠️ [Formation Rebuild] Skipping - no game players`

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Wait longer for the component to fully initialize (game fetch → team filtering → formation build)
2. Mock the `gamePlayers` state directly instead of relying on team filtering
3. Ensure the game fetch mock includes proper team data and completes before rendering
4. Use `act()` wrapper or better async handling for React state updates

---

### 2. `should allow "Game Was Played" with complete formation`
**Test Location**: `Starting Lineup Validation` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that the system allows marking a game as played when 11 players are assigned to the starting lineup.

**Expected Result**: API call to `/api/games/game1/start-game` with POST method

**Why it's failing**:
- **Root Cause**: Same as Test #1 - formation isn't being built, so validation fails before API call
- **Issue**: Component shows "Invalid Starting Lineup" error instead of proceeding to API call
- **Details**: The test expects the API call to happen, but validation is blocking it because formation is empty

**Potential Solutions**: Same as Test #1

---

### 3. `should show confirmation modal for small bench`
**Test Location**: `Bench Size Validation` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that a confirmation modal appears when trying to mark a game as played with fewer than 7 bench players.

**Expected Result**: Modal with title "Bench Size Warning" and message matching `/You have.*bench.*Are you sure/`

**Why it's failing**:
- **Root Cause**: Same formation building issue - validation fails before bench size check
- **Issue**: Component shows "Invalid Starting Lineup" error instead of bench warning modal
- **Details**: The test sets up 11 Starting Lineup + 3 Bench players, but formation isn't built, so starting lineup validation fails first

**Potential Solutions**: Same as Test #1

---

### 4. `should proceed when user confirms small bench`
**Test Location**: `Bench Size Validation` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that clicking "Continue" on the bench warning modal proceeds with marking the game as played.

**Expected Result**: API call to `/start-game` endpoint after clicking "Continue"

**Why it's failing**:
- **Root Cause**: Same as Test #3 - bench warning modal never appears because formation validation fails first
- **Issue**: Test can't find the confirmation modal because validation blocks before bench check

**Potential Solutions**: Same as Test #1

---

### 5. `should cancel when user cancels small bench confirmation`
**Test Location**: `Bench Size Validation` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that clicking "Go Back" on the bench warning modal cancels the action and doesn't call the API.

**Expected Result**: Modal closes, no API call to `/start-game`

**Why it's failing**:
- **Root Cause**: Same as Test #3 - bench warning modal never appears
- **Issue**: Test can't find the confirmation modal

**Potential Solutions**: Same as Test #1

---

### 6. `should block "Game Was Played" without goalkeeper`
**Test Location**: `Goalkeeper Validation` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that the system blocks marking a game as played when 11 players are assigned but none are goalkeepers.

**Expected Result**: Error modal with either:
- Frontend: "Missing Goalkeeper" title + "No goalkeeper assigned to the team" message
- OR Backend: "Error" title + "Starting lineup must include at least one goalkeeper" message

**Why it's failing**:
- **Root Cause**: Same formation building issue
- **Issue**: Component shows "Invalid Starting Lineup" error instead of goalkeeper validation error
- **Details**: Test sets up 11 players (players[1-11], skipping player[0] which is goalkeeper), but formation isn't built, so starting lineup validation fails first

**Potential Solutions**: Same as Test #1

---

### 7. `should provide clear error messages`
**Test Location**: `User Experience` suite

**What it tests**: Validates that clear, specific error messages are shown when validation fails (e.g., "Only 3 players in starting lineup").

**Expected Result**: Error message matching `/Cannot mark game as played.*Only \d+ players in starting lineup/` OR `/Cannot mark game as played.*No players assigned to starting lineup/`

**Why it's failing**:
- **Root Cause**: Same formation building issue
- **Issue**: Test sets up 3 players in Starting Lineup, but formation isn't built, so the error message might not match expected format
- **Details**: The component might show "No players assigned" instead of "Only 3 players" because formation auto-build didn't complete

**Potential Solutions**: Same as Test #1

---

## Common Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Formation Auto-Build Not Working in Tests

**The Problem**:
The component has a complex async initialization flow:
1. Component mounts → fetches game via `fetch()`
2. Game loads → triggers team filtering (`useEffect` depends on `game` and `players`)
3. Team filtering → sets `gamePlayers` state
4. `gamePlayers` + `gameRosters` → triggers formation auto-build (`useEffect` depends on `gamePlayers` and `localRosterStatuses`)
5. Formation auto-build → sets `formation` state
6. Validation checks `formation` → shows errors or proceeds

**Why Tests Fail**:
- Tests are asserting before step 4-5 complete
- `gamePlayers` is empty because team filtering (step 2-3) isn't completing
- Formation auto-build (step 4-5) requires `gamePlayers` to be populated
- Without formation, validation always fails with "No players assigned" or "Invalid Starting Lineup"

**Evidence from Console Logs**:
```
🔍 [Formation Rebuild] Effect triggered: {
  hasGamePlayers: true,
  gamePlayersCount: 0,  // ← EMPTY!
  hasRosterStatuses: true,
  rosterStatusesCount: 0,  // ← EMPTY!
  ...
}
⚠️ [Formation Rebuild] Skipping - no game players
```

## Technical Details

### Component Dependencies Chain
```
Game Fetch (async) 
  → game state set
    → Team Filtering (useEffect)
      → gamePlayers state set
        → Roster Loading (useEffect)
          → localRosterStatuses state set
            → Formation Auto-Build (useEffect)
              → formation state set
                → Validation checks formation
```

### Mock Setup Issues
1. **Game Fetch Mock**: Returns game data, but team filtering might not trigger immediately
2. **DataProvider Mock**: Returns `gameRosters`, but component loads them asynchronously
3. **Team Filtering**: Requires `game.team` to match `player.team`, but timing might be off
4. **Formation Building**: Requires both `gamePlayers` AND `localRosterStatuses` to be populated

### Current Test Setup
- ✅ Mock data structure is correct (team IDs match, positions match formation types)
- ✅ `gameRosters` structure is correct (`game: { _id: 'game1' }`, `player: { _id: ... }`)
- ✅ Game fetch mock returns correct format
- ❌ Timing: Tests don't wait long enough for async chain to complete
- ❌ State synchronization: React state updates aren't synchronized properly

## Recommended Solutions (Priority Order)

### Solution 1: Increase Wait Times and Add Proper Async Handling ⭐⭐⭐
**Effort**: Low | **Likelihood of Success**: Medium

- Add longer timeouts (5000ms instead of 3000ms)
- Use `waitFor` with custom matchers that check for `gamePlayers.length > 0`
- Add explicit waits between async operations
- Use `act()` wrapper for state updates

### Solution 2: Mock Component State Directly ⭐⭐⭐
**Effort**: Medium | **Likelihood of Success**: High

- Instead of relying on async chain, mock `gamePlayers` state directly
- Use `jest.spyOn` to intercept `useState` for `gamePlayers`
- Set `localRosterStatuses` directly via state mock
- Bypass team filtering and formation building for tests

### Solution 3: Refactor Component for Testability ⭐
**Effort**: High | **Likelihood of Success**: High

- Extract formation building logic into a separate hook
- Make team filtering a separate hook
- Add dependency injection for async operations
- This is a larger refactor but would make testing much easier

### Solution 4: Use Integration Test Helpers ⭐⭐
**Effort**: Medium | **Likelihood of Success**: Medium

- Create test helper functions that wait for specific states
- Create `waitForGamePlayers()` helper
- Create `waitForFormation()` helper
- Use these helpers in all tests

---

## Notes

- **Production Code Works**: These are test setup issues, not production bugs
- **All Critical Scenarios Verified**: Production verification confirmed all scenarios work correctly
- **Test Coverage**: The validation logic itself is tested in unit tests (`squadValidation.test.js`)
- **Priority**: Low - These tests are integration tests for UI flow, not critical path validation

## Next Steps (When Ready to Fix)

1. **Investigate timing**: Add more detailed console logs to understand exact timing of state updates
2. **Try Solution 1 first**: Increase timeouts and add proper async handling
3. **If Solution 1 fails**: Try Solution 2 (direct state mocking)
4. **Consider**: Whether these integration tests add value beyond unit tests + E2E tests

## Fouls Not Draftable - Data Loss Risk

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19  
**Resolved**: 2024-12-19

**Priority**: Medium (was Medium)

---

### The Problem

After the disciplinary architecture refactor, **fouls committed/received** are stored in the `PlayerMatchStat` collection (separate from player reports). However, unlike other data edited in `PlayerPerformanceDialog` (ratings, notes), fouls are **not included in the `reportDraft`** system.

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ **Ratings/Notes**: Saved to `reportDraft` → Survive page refresh → Loaded from draft on game load
- ❌ **Fouls**: Saved directly to `PlayerMatchStat` → **Lost on page refresh** → Not restored from draft

**User Impact**:
- User edits fouls in `PlayerPerformanceDialog` → `DetailedDisciplinarySection`
- Page refreshes (browser crash, network issue, accidental navigation)
- **Fouls data is lost** (not saved to draft)
- User must re-enter fouls manually

---

### Technical Details

**Current Architecture**:
- `reportDraft` structure (in `Game` model):
  ```javascript
  {
    teamSummary: { ... },
    finalScore: { ... },
    matchDuration: { ... },
    playerReports: { playerId: { ratings, notes } }  // ✅ Draftable
  }
  ```

- `PlayerMatchStat` structure (separate collection):
  ```javascript
  {
    gameId: ObjectId,
    playerId: ObjectId,
    disciplinary: {
      foulsCommitted: Number,  // ❌ NOT draftable
      foulsReceived: Number    // ❌ NOT draftable
    }
  }
  ```

**Why This Happened**:
- During refactor, fouls were moved from `DisciplinaryAction` to `PlayerMatchStat`
- `PlayerMatchStat` is a separate collection (not part of `Game` model)
- Draft system only handles data stored in `Game.reportDraft` field
- Fouls are saved immediately via `upsertPlayerMatchStats` API (no draft step)

---

### Potential Solutions

#### Solution 1: Include PlayerMatchStats in reportDraft ⭐⭐⭐
**Effort**: Medium | **Likelihood of Success**: High | **Recommended**

**Implementation**:
1. Extend `reportDraft` structure to include `playerMatchStats`:
   ```javascript
   {
     teamSummary: { ... },
     finalScore: { ... },
     matchDuration: { ... },
     playerReports: { ... },
     playerMatchStats: {  // ✅ NEW
       playerId: {
         disciplinary: { foulsCommitted, foulsReceived },
         shooting: { ... },
         passing: { ... }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Update `PUT /api/games/:gameId/draft` endpoint:
   - Accept `playerMatchStats` in request body
   - Save to `game.reportDraft.playerMatchStats`
   - Merge with existing draft (preserve other fields)

3. Update `PlayerPerformanceDialog` autosave:
   - Include `playerMatchStats` in `reportDataForAutosave` memo
   - Save fouls to draft when edited (via `useAutosave` hook)

4. Update draft loading logic:
   - Load `playerMatchStats` from `reportDraft` on game load
   - Restore fouls to `PlayerPerformanceDialog` state

5. On final submission (when game marked as "Done"):
   - Save `playerMatchStats` from draft to `PlayerMatchStat` collection
   - Clear `reportDraft` after successful save

**Pros**:
- Consistent with other draftable data
- Prevents data loss
- Simple to implement (extends existing draft system)

**Cons**:
- Adds complexity to draft structure
- Requires migration for existing drafts (if any)

---

#### Solution 2: Save Fouls Immediately + Add Draft Backup ⭐⭐
**Effort**: Low | **Likelihood of Success**: Medium

**Implementation**:
1. Keep immediate save to `PlayerMatchStat` (current behavior)
2. Also save fouls to `reportDraft` as backup
3. On page load, check both:
   - If `PlayerMatchStat` exists → use it (source of truth)
   - If `PlayerMatchStat` missing but draft exists → restore from draft

**Pros**:
- Dual-layer protection
- Minimal changes to existing code

**Cons**:
- Potential inconsistency between draft and saved data
- More complex loading logic

---

#### Solution 3: Document as Expected Behavior ⭐
**Effort**: Low | **Likelihood of Success**: Low

**Implementation**:
- Document that fouls are not draftable
- Add UI warning: "Fouls are saved immediately. Changes will be lost if page refreshes before saving."
- Accept data loss risk

**Pros**:
- No code changes needed
- Clear user expectations

**Cons**:
- Poor user experience
- Data loss risk remains
- Inconsistent with other dialog fields

---

### Recommended Approach

**Solution 1** is recommended because:
1. **Consistency**: Fouls are edited in the same dialog as ratings/notes
2. **User Expectation**: Users expect all dialog data to be draftable
3. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental data loss
4. **Future-Proof**: Extensible for other `PlayerMatchStat` fields (shooting, passing)
